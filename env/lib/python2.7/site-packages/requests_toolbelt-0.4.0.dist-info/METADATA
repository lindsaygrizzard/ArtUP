Description: requests toolbelt
        =================
        
        This is just a collection of utilities for `python-requests`_, but don't 
        really belong in ``requests`` proper. The minimum tested requests version is 
        ``2.1.0``. In reality, the toolbelt should work with ``2.0.1`` as well, but 
        some idiosyncracies prevent effective or sane testing on that version.
        
        
        multipart/form-data Encoder
        ---------------------------
        
        The main attraction is a streaming multipart form-data object, ``MultipartEncoder``.
        Its API looks like this:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from requests_toolbelt import MultipartEncoder
            import requests
        
            m = MultipartEncoder(
                fields={'field0': 'value', 'field1': 'value',
                        'field2': ('filename', open('file.py', 'rb'), 'text/plain')}
                )
        
            r = requests.post('http://httpbin.org/post', data=m,
                              headers={'Content-Type': m.content_type})
        
        
        You can also use ``multipart/form-data`` encoding for requests that don't
        require files:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from requests_toolbelt import MultipartEncoder
            import requests
        
            m = MultipartEncoder(fields={'field0': 'value', 'field1': 'value'})
        
            r = requests.post('http://httpbin.org/post', data=m,
                              headers={'Content-Type': m.content_type})
        
        
        Or, you can just create the string and examine the data:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Assuming `m` is one of the above
            m.to_string()  # Always returns unicode
        
        
        User-Agent constructor
        ----------------------
        
        You can easily construct a requests-style ``User-Agent`` string::
        
            from requests_toolbelt import user_agent
        
            headers = {
                'User-Agent': user_agent('my_package', '0.0.1')
                }
        
            r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/users', headers=headers)
        
        
        SSLAdapter
        ----------
        
        The ``SSLAdapter`` was originally published on `Cory Benfield's blog`_. 
        This adapter allows the user to choose one of the SSL protocols made available 
        in Python's ``ssl`` module for outgoing HTTPS connections:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from requests_toolbelt import SSLAdapter
            import requests
            import ssl
        
            s = requests.Session()
            s.mount('https://', SSLAdapter(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1))
        
        
        Known Issues
        ------------
        
        On Python 3.3.0 and 3.3.1, the standard library's ``http`` module will fail
        when passing an instance of the ``MultipartEncoder``. This is fixed in later
        minor releases of Python 3.3. Please consider upgrading to a later minor
        version or Python 3.4. *There is absolutely nothing this library can do to
        work around that bug.*

        History
        =======
        
        0.4.0 -- 2015-04-03
        -------------------
        
        For more information about this release, please see `milestone 0.4.0 
        <https://github.com/sigmavirus24/requests-toolbelt/issues/46>`_ on the 
        project's page.
        
        New Features
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - A naive implemenation of a thread pool is now included in the toolbelt. See 
          the docs in ``docs/threading.rst`` or on `Read The Docs 
          <https://toolbelt.readthedocs.org>`_.
        
        - The ``StreamingIterator`` now accepts files (such as ``sys.stdin``) without 
          a specific length and will properly stream them.
        
        - The ``MultipartEncoder`` now accepts exactly the same format of fields as 
          requests' ``files`` parameter does. In other words, you can now also pass in 
          extra headers to add to a part in the body. You can also now specify a 
          custom ``Content-Type`` for a part.
        
        - An implementation of HTTP Digest Authentication for Proxies is now included.
        
        - A transport adapter that allows a user to specify a specific Certificate 
          Fingerprint is now included in the toolbelt.
        
        - A transport adapter that simplifies how users specify socket options is now 
          included.
        
        - A transport adapter that simplifies how users can specify TCP Keep-Alive 
          options is now included in the toolbelt.
        
        - Deprecated functions from ``requests.utils`` are now included and 
          maintained.
        
        - An authentication tool that allows users to specify how to authenticate to 
          several different domains at once is now included.
        
        - A function to save streamed responses to disk by analyzing the 
          ``Content-Disposition`` header is now included in the toolbelt.
        
        Fixed Bugs
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The ``MultipartEncoder`` will now allow users to upload files larger than 
          4GB on 32-bit systems.
        
        - The ``MultipartEncoder`` will now accept empty unicode strings for form 
          values.
        
        0.3.1 -- 2014-06-23
        -------------------
        
        - Fix the fact that 0.3.0 bundle did not include the ``StreamingIterator``
        
        0.3.0 -- 2014-05-21
        -------------------
        
        Bug Fixes
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Complete rewrite of ``MultipartEncoder`` fixes bug where bytes were lost in
          uploads
        
        New Features
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - ``MultipartDecoder`` to accept ``multipart/form-data`` response bodies and
          parse them into an easy to use object.
        
        - ``SourceAddressAdapter`` to allow users to choose a local address to bind
          connections to.
        
        - ``GuessAuth`` which accepts a username and password and uses the
          ``WWW-Authenticate`` header to determine how to authenticate against a
          server.
        
        - ``MultipartEncoderMonitor`` wraps an instance of the ``MultipartEncoder``
          and keeps track of how many bytes were read and will call the provided
          callback.
        
        - ``StreamingIterator`` will wrap an iterator and stream the upload instead of
          chunk it, provided you also provide the length of the content you wish to
          upload.
        
        0.2.0 -- 2014-02-24
        -------------------
        
        - Add ability to tell ``MultipartEncoder`` which encoding to use. By default
          it uses 'utf-8'.
        
        - Fix #10 - allow users to install with pip
        
        - Fix #9 - Fix ``MultipartEncoder#to_string`` so that it properly handles file
          objects as fields
        
        0.1.2 -- 2014-01-19
        -------------------
        
        - At some point during development we broke how we handle normal file objects.
          Thanks to @konomae this is now fixed.
        
        0.1.1 -- 2014-01-19
        -------------------
        
        - Handle ``io.BytesIO``-like objects better
        
        0.1.0 -- 2014-01-18
        -------------------
        
        - Add initial implementation of the streaming ``MultipartEncoder``
        
        - Add initial implementation of the ``user_agent`` function
        
        - Add the ``SSLAdapter``
